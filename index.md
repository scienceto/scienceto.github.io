# Hey there, I'm Jheel!

Welcome to my digital corner! ðŸš€

## About Me

I am a passionate **Cloud Developer** based in the city of Rochester, NY, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology.

## What I Do

My journey in the tech world began with my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Nirma University. After completing my Bachelor's, I joined Searce as a Cloud Engineering Analyst. Here, I've had the privilege of designing and implementing cloud-native solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of our clients. From optimizing Google Cloud platform infrastructure to automating tedious processes, I'm all about maximizing efficiency and driving results.

## Projects That Make Me Tick

Here are a few projects that truly represent my passion for innovation:

- **Cloud Wellness Assessment Automation:** Enhanced the way we conduct Cloud Wellness assessments by deploying an agile, cloud-native automation solution on Google Cloud. This solution significantly reduced manual efforts by 60-70% while also establishing a more efficient standard for cloud operations.

- **Large Scale Object Storage Migration:** Led a large-scale object storage migration from AWS S3 to Google Cloud Storage. By migrating a whopping 700 TB of data, we achieved significant cost savings and reduced migration time by an impressive 40%.

- **ITSM - Monitoring Tools Integration:** Architected and implemented a seamless integration solution connecting various monitoring alert sources with our ITSM tool. This initiative streamlined incident handling and boosted operational efficiency.
